This is meant to satirize code behaviour through personification. 

## Dissociative identity disorder
- Open-sourced, disorganized documentation
- Spontaneously vanishing teammates: user is online in slack but unresponsive 🙃

## ADHD
- Deadline velocity
- High density of novel ideas
- Unfinished integration

## Dyslexia
- Spatial reasoning, diagrammatic logic
- Supports gesture-only input

## Bipolar I
- High impact idea
- Deleted and resurrected at closing ceremony
- Built authentic connection
- Pitch induces mania in judges

## Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Abstraction stack elegance
- References to obscure research papers
- Latex slides with no animations
Bonus, track norms:
- Hyperfocus zone
- Clearly label *all* items!
- Headphones encouraged
- Executive function aids: templated streamlined submission, 1-click deploys

## Schizotypal
- Highly original concept
- Interface nonlinearity
- Explanation lucidity

## Borderline PD:
- Aesthetic, deeply addicting interfaces
- Maintainer response time: 1ms -> 30s -> infinite ghost.
(bonuses)
