# About 
Good meowning! I'm Yoyo, travelling as a packet to you! 

I'm a worldbuilder, cognitive science enthusiast and creative technologist. I'm super obsessed with symbiosis of humans and machines.

### My current quests
- ArXiv Wars: academic paper triaging through bots that fight on discord!
- Building bio-computers that can smell!

Affiliation: Student at Minerva University (class of 2028)

### These are some communities I love
- Cyborgism and transhumanism
- [Prototypesf](https://prototypesf.org)
- [Ekkolapto](https://ekkolapto.org)
- [cimc.ai](https://cimc.ai)
- [noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge)   
also see [link stash](links.html)

### My personality is as such
- Openness: 95%
- Conscientiousness: 60%
- Extroversion: 65%
- Agreeableness: 62%
- Neuroticism: 43%

Socionics: ILE intuitive.
Alignment: Chaotic good.

Vibes: “Warm and tweety vibes” “contagious enthusiasm” "strange speech patterns that remind them of the grad student species” "mysterious entity in a midnight forest"
Feedback form: tell it to my face! 

### Work preferences
- Work style: Pioneer/Integrator  
- Nonlinear thought process: I tend to generate a ton of new ideas and notice patterns. I tend to be very perceptive. I oscillate between the two.
- Keep team meetings as efficient and concise as possible
- Long focus periods   
- Context: Small team (< 7), ambient noise with no music, in-person preferred (but 6 years of experience with online school), makerspaces/dry labs with equipment. Flexible work schedule. 

### Interaction style
**Preferred:** In-person meetups, followed by any types of voice calling, voice-coworking. I might not text consistently.

Fastest responses are at (within minutes to hours):
- Signal
- Telegram
- Discord
- [X](https://x.com/indiraschka)

Slower:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoyo-yuan/)
- [Email](mailto:yoyoyuan1729@gmail.com)

**Feedback:** Be honest without being brutal. It’s easy for me to update my priors during conversations, as long as you present evidence!.

### 99th percentile
- Transdisciplinary idea synthesis
- Synthetic worldbuilding. I'm hyperphantasic.
- Pattern recognition. I'm highly perceptive, and could break down a complex problem into concrete pieces, creating flowcharts for complex systems.
- Self-awareness and metacognition

### Strong
- Resourceful. Figuring out how to solve fuzzy problems with few constraints in 72 hours.
- Research and development
- Writing, technical or academic or creative.
- Shaping communities

### Some topics
- astrophysics and cosmology
- quantum computing
- swarm algorithms, alife
- homomorphic encryption
- non-invasive BCIs
- software engineering
- hardware integration

### Bad at
- Saying no
- Delegating. I sometimes don't ask for help.
- Consistency. 
- Non-communicating. I'm not very aware of this when it happens. Again, most of time I might have gotten distracted, 20% of the time I overthink. If I don’t reply in a long time, try texting again, sorry! If I still don’t reply after many tries, I might’ve gotten uncomfortable by something you did.
- Too many projects at once. 

### Good collaborations look like
- **Good execution.** Can think long term, short term and act with urgency. Can be reliable during stressful situations.
- **Accountable.** If you make promises, you’re expected to do it. If something comes up, and you can’t make a meeting or complete a task, communicating asap is preferred.
- **Gives honest feedback**
- **Reasonably optimistic**
- **Willing to learn**

### Potential conflicts
Things I unintentionally do which may be annoying:
- I get very loud when excited and be mistaken for anger
- texting you information without giving complete context (I’m not aware when this happens)

**What may annoy me if done repeatedly:**
- spilling people's secrets to everyone
- pretending you care
- low curiosity, excessive complaining (particularly learned helplessness), malicious intentions, contempt
- overuse of professionalism in a personal context, stereotyping (ethnicity and gender)
- being forced to do inefficient stuff when there is a clearly better option
- repeatedly visiting my place at 2 am

If you really annoy me, I'm usually not confrontational and will distance you.

### How to become friends
If you're reading this far, say hi!
- covibing (come to my place!)
- coliving (no spots open right now)
- reverse engineering things
- noisebridge
- join cool events
- build scraps
- applied chemistry/food
- snake
- dance! running around without an aim
- collecting obscure knowledge, docs, lost media
- generative art and ascii art
- break into place (e.g. treehacks)
- listening to joscha bach and have a heated debate on consciousness ending in jokes about epistemic uncertainty
- making 1000 signal group chats
- send cool links, and do it over weeks or months or possibly years. (paper spam is welcome!)
- urban sketching
- moon gazing
- bio-art
- lie on grass
- blasting techno music loudly
- hackathons, me watching people code
- just, call me on discord or signal when I'm online and texting.
Some wonderful memories with friends included optimizing Pelmeni per dollar, hacking on the uss hornet, trying to save friend’s life at 12 am, or running through an empty coworking space at midnight.

### Sample of things 
- Russia, Finland, Singapore, India
- Hopscotch forums

### Dating
This section is intentionally unclear to encourage open-endedness.
- I can turn you into a cat
- respect scene names! do not "out" someone if you don't have their permission!

### Music (sample)
