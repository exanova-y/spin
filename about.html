Good meowning! I'm Yoyo, travelling as a data packet to you! I'm a sci-fi worldbuilder, trandisciplinary researcher and cognitive science enthusiast. Expanded biography is at bottom of page :)

### My current quests
- ArXiv Wars. Triaging high quality academic papers through bots that argue on discord!
- Scent context protocol. Store and retrieve scent memories with language models. 

I subscribe to Erd≈ës's [itinerant, social philosophy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Paul_Erd%C5%91s). Self-sculpted polymathic people like [Heaviside](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/oliver-heaviside-self-taught-pioneer-electromagnetism-vector-calculus/), Tesla and Faraday influence me. Scientific progress is dwelling in the unknown and autodidacts alter the trajectory significantly. See [Alec Radford](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hi3tth/alec_radford_the_lead_author_of_openais_original/), [Dr. Kitty Yeung](https://artbyphysicistkittyyeung.com/) for modern examples of polymaths. I'm obsessed with sympoietic technologies expanding human agency. 

Formal affiliation: Student at Minerva University (class of 2028)

### My personality is as such
- Openness: 95%
- Conscientiousness: 60%
- Extroversion: 65%
- Agreeableness: 87%
- Neuroticism: 43%

Category: ILE intuitive subtype, chaotic good.

Vibes: "Warm and tweety vibes" "contagious enthusiasm" "strange speech patterns that remind them of the grad student species" "mysterious entity in a midnight forest"
Feedback form: tell it to my face! 

### Work preferences
- Work style: Pioneer/Integrator  
- Nonlinear thought process: I tend to generate a ton of new ideas or notice patterns and converge onto one thing. I oscillate between the two. 
- Keep team meetings as efficient and concise as possible
- Long focus periods   
- Context: Small team (< 7), ambient noise with no music, in-person preferred (but 6 years of experience with online school), makerspaces/dry labs with equipment. Flexible work schedule. 

### Interaction modality
**Preferred:** In-person meetups, followed by any types of voice calling, voice-coworking. I might not text consistently.

Fastest responses are at (within minutes to hours):
- Signal
- Telegram
- Discord
- [X](https://x.com/indiraschka)

Slower:
- Email: yoyo at mesh.host

**Feedback:** Be honest without being brutal. It's easy for me to update my priors during conversations, as long as you present evidence!.

### 99th percentile
- Transdisciplinary idea generation
- Hyperfantasiac worldbuilding
- Pattern recognition. I'm highly perceptive, and could break down a complex problem into concrete pieces, creating flowcharts for complex systems.
- Self-awareness and metacognition

### Strong
- Resourceful. Figuring out how to solve fuzzy problems with few constraints in 72 hours.
- Running research teams 
- Writing: technical or academic or creative.
- Shaping communities and movements

### Some topics
- astrophysics and cosmology
- quantum computing
- swarm algorithms, alife
- homomorphic encryption
- non-invasive BCIs
- software engineering
- hardware integration

### Bad at
- Saying no
- Delegating. I sometimes don't ask for help.
- Consistency. 
- Non-communicating. I'm not very aware of this when it happens. Again, most of time I might have gotten distracted, 20% of the time I overthink. If I don't reply in a long time, try texting again, sorry! If I still don't reply after many tries, I might've gotten uncomfortable by something you did.
- Too many projects at once

### Improving on:
- Execution skills

### Good collaborations look like
- **Good execution.** Can think long term, short term and act with urgency. Can be reliable during stressful situations.
- **Accountable.** If you make promises, you're expected to do it. If something comes up, and you can't make a meeting or complete a task, communicating asap is preferred.
- **Gives honest feedback**
- **Reasonably optimistic**
- **Willing to learn**

### Potential conflicts
Things I unintentionally do which may be annoying:
- I get very loud when excited and be mistaken for anger
- talking way too much
- texting you information without giving complete context (I'm not aware when this happens)
- last minute changes (mostly because of health issue flare-ups)

**What may annoy me if done repeatedly:**
- spilling people's secrets to everyone
- excessive chaos and taking way too long to complete a thing üòÖ
- low curiosity, excessive complaining (particularly learned helplessness), malicious intentions, contempt
- overuse of professionalism in a personal context, stereotyping (ethnicity and gender)
- being forced to do inefficient stuff when there is a clearly better option
- repeatedly visiting my place at 2 am

If you really annoy me, I'm usually not confrontational and will distance you.

### How to become friends
If you're reading this far, say hi!

I tend to be very perceptive, I could easily pick up on changes in tones or body language. However, I couldn't always verbalize this.
- covibing/working (come to my place!)
- coliving (no spots open right now)
- reverse engineering things
- noisebridge
- join cool events
- build scraps
- applied chemistry/food
- snake
- dance! running around without an aim
- collecting obscure knowledge, docs, lost media
- generative art and ascii art
- break into place (e.g. treehacks)
- listening to joscha bach and have a heated debate on consciousness ending in jokes about epistemic uncertainty
- making 1000 signal group chats
- send cool links, and do it over weeks or months or possibly years. (paper spam is welcome!)
- urban sketching
- moon gazing
- bio-art
- lie on grass
- blasting techno music loudly
- hackathons, me watching people code
- just, call me on discord or signal when I'm online and texting.
Some wonderful memories with friends included optimizing Pelmeni per dollar, hacking on the uss hornet, trying to save friend's life at 12 am, or running through an empty coworking space at midnight.

### (Do not) date
Have you seen the noisebridge [do not hack sign](https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Please-Do-Not-Hack-by-Makutu/100210332.EJUG5)!!!
The same principle applies.

### Expanded biography
Born in Shenzhen‚ÄîChina‚Äôs hardware Silicon Valley‚ÄîI spent kindergarten drawing fractal-like petals that teachers dismissed as "not flowers." By second grade, I noticed rewards went to sycophants, not the curious. So I designed and sold custom bookmarks and stickers, sparking a black market of creativity among classmates.

When an art teacher punished students for "wasting paint" (i.e., experimenting), I organized a rebellion: an open-ended weekend art event, encouraging creativity and exposing hypocrisy. My tact involved two stages. Within months, parent complaints got him fired.

Outside school, I coded obsessively on Hopscotch, a children‚Äôs platform, creating thousands of projects‚Äîsocial networks, physics simulations, optical illusions‚Äîmany trending community-wide. I taught myself English via late-night forum chats with people in EST and devoured podcasts on Perelman, Feynman, Curie, etc. My comics about coding adventures filled four drawers and were loved among my friends. I spent most of my weekends at the university library, buried in fascinating books about chemistry, physics, astronomy, psychology and many more! I built mobile apps: a STEM resource hub and a tool for the myopic elderly. But my intensity and hyperfixation confused adults. Once, while explaining 3D rendering on a 2D engine to my Australian host family, I was punched and reported for "bullying." On a daily basis, teachers mocked my interests, taunted me that I should de-exist and monitored my calls.

Back in Shenzhen, I launched ‚ÄúThe Quibbler‚Äù (a Harry Potter-inspired zine). Friends volunteered to draw, write, edit and distribute it. Every edition would expose flaws in the education system. It went viral in school, leading to two teachers being fired. Administrators panicked, banned it repeatedly and even analyzed the handwritings attempting to infer the authors. Friends kept resurrecting it. Kicked out of class for being "too nerdy", I‚Äôd sit in hallways reading astrophysics books, musing how knowledge and school were unrelated. A friend urged me: "This system‚Äôs rigged. Leave. Teach yourself like Faraday and Tesla."

After elementary school, I relocated to Canada! Adults dismissed my interests as ‚Äúbaby science‚Äù. As people endlessly fought in the background, I wanted to run toward a more exciting world, inspired by Sumerian goddess Inanna‚Äôs triad: power, wisdom and love.

I learned financial markets: Starting with $10k on a simulated trading platform with real market data, it grew into $40k over three months. I was also top 1% in Canada‚Äôs UWaterloo financial literacy contest.

I reverse-engineered sci-fi tech in three adventures in high school:

1. Neurotech. With an OpenBCI biosensing kit, I built EOG/EMG interfaces that controlled games with eye movements, detected facial expressions and generated music. I wrote technical analyses on Neuralink and Brain-Computer Interfaces for ADHD, which led to a collaboration with University of Waterloo‚Äôs multisensory brain and cognition lab. I competed 2nd place in Waterloo brain bee, and then dove into computational neuroscience.
2. Quantum computing. As I didn‚Äôt know linear algebra, I brute-forced it by binging youtube and links 5 hours at a time. Subsequently, I joined a quantum physics research seminar. Delivering weekly presentations motivated me to quickly learn concepts such as the Sunyaev‚ÄìZeldovich effect and Hilbert spaces. My group delivered a final presentation about finite potential wells and published a review on quantum simulators.
3. Swarm robotics. I heard of this concept from a UWaterloo engineering lab where I built a haptic hand interface to control a swarm of robots, and ran an interest group at Minerva University.

Now, I‚Äôm rallying friends to build scent context protocol, arxiv wars and computing with neurons. Sci-fi fuels me‚ÄîThe Matrix, Interstellar, the Optimalverse, the genius trilogy etc. My projects are subtle acts of defiance against systems that reward conformity over creativity. I‚Äôm drawn to technologies that expand human agency, whether through brain interfaces, multi-agent interactions, quantum leaps or more.
