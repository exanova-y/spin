# Readlogs — local mirror

Local mirror of five posts by *Yoyo is defocusing ultrasound*
(Substack: `feralscholars.substack.com`, formerly linked as `pawsitivefeedback.substack.com`).

All images are downloaded locally under `images/` and referenced with relative
paths rather than hotlinked to Substack's CDN.

## Layout

Flat — every post is a top-level `.md` + generated `.html`, all sharing one
`images/` folder. Image filenames are prefixed with the post slug to avoid
collisions.

```

## Notes

- The `pawsitivefeedback.substack.com/p/…` URLs originally requested all return 404.
  The publication was renamed / moved to `feralscholars.substack.com`; the post slugs
  are otherwise identical. Content was fetched from the current live URLs.
- Substack footnote markers (`[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`) from the source were removed as
  their target footnotes were not present in the rendered page content.
- Some Substack captions/quotes were inline in raw HTML; punctuation and paragraph
  breaks were normalized for readability but wording is unchanged.
- Images are stored at their original resolution as delivered by
  `substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com` (no `w_1456` CDN transform).

## Rebuilding

```bash
# fetch all images fresh
bash download_images.sh

# re-render every .md into a matching .html
python3 build.py
```
