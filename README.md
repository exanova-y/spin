# adiabatic.garden

A highly scalable, fast, and minimalist personal website built using **Eleventy (11ty)**, featuring Math/LaTeX support (KaTeX) and beautiful static rendering.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run Local Development Server
Starts a local web server with hot-reloading at `http://localhost:8080`:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Build Static Site
Compiles your entire site into the `_site/` directory:
```bash
npm run build
```

## ✍️ How to Publish a New Post

Writing and publishing is now fully automated. There are no compile scripts or manual index lists to update.

1. Create a new Markdown (`.md`) file in **`src/pages/`** (or **`src/favs/`** if it's a favorite/featured post).
2. At the very top of the file, define your post's metadata using YAML front matter:

```markdown
---
layout: layouts/post.njk
title: "My New Article Title"
date: 2026-06-21
author: "Yoyo"
category: "lab"       # Choose: "lab", "problems", or "stories" (or "favs" for favorites)
---

This is your post content written in **Markdown**.

### KaTeX / Math Formulas
You can write inline math formulas using `$E = mc^2$` or block equations:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

On the standalone homepage, wrap a formula in `<span class="math">...</span>`; its scoped KaTeX renderer avoids interpreting unrelated text as math.

If you ever want to decouple a file's physical name from its compiled web URL, you can define a permalink variable directly in the post's front matter:
---
layout: layouts/post.njk
title: "MRI and ultrasound physics"
date: 2026-04-09
category: "favs"
permalink: "/neuroscience/mri-and-ultrasound/"   # Custom variable URL!


3. Git-commit and push! Your `/writing` page directory will automatically update and sort the post chronologically (newest first).

Each post's source Markdown is also published beside its rendered page: for example,
`/pages/hope/` is available as plain text at `/pages/hope.md`.
The homepage and About page publish shared Person JSON-LD; each post references that
identity in its Article JSON-LD author data.

## 🌲 Forester-style trees

Writing is rendered the way [forester](https://forest.localcharts.org/lc-0002.xml)
renders a forest: a note is a *tree*, and its own sections are trees in their own
right — numbered, collapsible, and separately addressable.

Every note gets a stable public address (`note-0048`) from `src/_data/noteIds.js`,
shown next to its title as `[note-0048]`. **Never reuse an address** after removing
a note. Headings inside a note are addressed under it (`#note-0048-links`), so the
same anchor works on the note's own page and in a composed view.

Two layouts share one renderer (`src/_includes/forest-tree.njk`):

| Layout | Used by | The note is… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `layouts/post.njk` | every `.md` note | the root tree, with its own contents sidebar and backmatter |
| `layouts/forest.njk` | `src/writing/*.njk` | one numbered subtree among many, transcluded into a whole collection |

A note's **taxon** (the genre printed before its number — "Note 4", "Story 2")
comes from its `category`; set `taxon: "…"` in front matter to override it. Only
numbered trees carry a label, so a note on its own page shows just its title and
address — the taxon would repeat what the address already says.

To compose a new collection into a single document, add a file to `src/writing/`:

```yaml
---
layout: layouts/forest.njk
title: Lab notebook
description: Experiments, research notes, and technical fragments in one view.
collectionName: lab          # any collection defined in .eleventy.js
permalink: /writing/lab-notebook/index.html
---
```

Following forester, a transcluded note's backmatter is suppressed — related
links appear only on the note's own page, where it is the root.

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
Every `git push` to your main branch will automatically trigger Vercel to compile and deploy your site from the `_site` directory using clean URLs.

### Cloudflare Pages
To deploy manually to Cloudflare Pages, run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
### Sync curius bookmarks
Fetch all bookmarks from the Curius API into `src/_data/curius.json`:
```
npm run fetch:curius
```

### Related-links recommendations
Each post shows "Related links from Yoyo's bookshelf" at the bottom. Two engines:

1. **Build-time TF-IDF** (default, no setup): `.eleventy.js` `relatedBookmarks` filter scores
   bookmarks against each page by keyword cosine similarity. Always works.
2. **Embeddings + HDBSCAN** (better, optional): precomputes semantic matches with OpenAI
   embeddings and clusters bookmarks. When `src/_data/related.json` exists it takes priority
   over the TF-IDF fallback.

To (re)build the embedding matches:
```
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
npm run embed:curius          # writes src/_data/related.json + curius-clusters.json
npm run build
```
`embed:curius` caches vectors in `src/_data/.embed-cache.json` (gitignored), so re-runs only
embed new/changed bookmarks and pages. Re-run it after `fetch:curius` or after editing posts.
